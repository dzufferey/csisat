Requirements:
  - OCaml with the C headers installed
  - glpk

Build:
make

Configuration:
The Makefile assumes the following:
  - The ocaml headers and glpk headers are in the default include path.
    If this is not the case, please modify the Makefile for glpk,
    or glpk_ml_wrapper/Makefile for ocaml.
  - For static linking, the files 'libglpk.a', 'libz.a', 'libltdl.a', and
    'libdl.a' are located in '/usr/lib/'.
    If this is not the case, please modify the GLPK variable in the Makefile.
    This variable and LIBS are adapted for GLPK 4.28.
    In the case of dynamic linking, the makefile does not depend on the
    version of GLPK.
If you want to compile a statically linked version, run 'make STATIC=1'
