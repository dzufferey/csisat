PicoSAT integration:
	-fix known bug in getting the proof for PicoSat

LA:
    -get implied equalites:
     faster incremental implementation ?? (seems not any faster)
    -use the arbitrary precision solver (when no more that experimental)

EUF:
	-improve the unsat core (over-approximation)

Theories:
    -array theory
	-add difference logic (and later utvpi ?)
    -Linear Diophantine (Dis)Equations and Linear Modular Equations


Sat Solver:
    -bug for trivial boolean formula in 'sat' mode
    -sat solver decision policy.

General:
    -multiple interpolant from one query (path): do not go each time through the proof.
    -cleanup the code
    -makefile: call ocamlbuild
