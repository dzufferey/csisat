Requirements:
  - OCaml with the C headers installed
  - glpk

Build:
make

Configuration:
The Makefile assumes the following:
  - The file 'libglpk.a' is located in '/usr/lib/'.
    If this is not the case, please modify the GLPK variable in the Makefile.
  - The ocaml headers and glpk headers are in the default include path.
    If this is not the case, please modify the Makefile for glpk,
    or glpk_ml_wrapper/Makefile for ocaml.
If you want to compile a statically linked version, un-comment the line
"#STATIC = -ccopt '-static'"
