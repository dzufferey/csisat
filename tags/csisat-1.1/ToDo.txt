sat solver:
	-get proof

LA:
    -get implied equalites (faster incremental implementation ??)
    -overapprox for the unsat core -> faster

EUF:
	-improve the unsat core (overappoximation)

Nelson Oppen:

DL:
	-add difference logic


Delayed theory combination:
    -needed ??

General:
    -multiple interpolant from one query (path)
