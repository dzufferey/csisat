PicoSAT integration:
	-fix known bug in getting the proof for PicoSat

LA:
    -get implied equalites:
     faster incremental implementation ?? (seems not any faster)
    -use the arbitrary precision solver (when no more that experimental)

EUF:
	-improve the unsat core (over-approximation)
    -implement incremental EUF solver:
        maintains a stack of added eq-constraints with previous representative values (when changed).
        the path compression also add info when it changes the state.
        changes have to be undone in reverse order.

Nelson Oppen:

DL:
	-add difference logic

Delayed theory combination:
    -needed ?? (not really )

Sat Solver:
    -bug for trivial boolean formula in 'sat' mode
    -sat solver decision policy.

General:
    -multiple interpolant from one query (path): finish the code
    -cleanup the code
